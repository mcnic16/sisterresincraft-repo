[View live project](https://mcnic16.github.io/sisterresincraft-repo/shop.html)



This is the Website for Sister Resin Crafts. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential customers with potential developments to be added in the future.
Currently all items on the site are linked to an Etsy shop. Items cannot be purchased through the website but this development will be added at a later date.
On the Home page there is a featured items list, which will be updated to show all the new items available. On the About page a form has been included for customer queries and requests. Future development of this feature will include customers being able to review the website and items purchased.

 ## Testing User Stories from User Experience  Section

 - As I first time visitor I would like:

The about page of the website includes an about us section and details of the business policies of the business.

2. For the site to be user friendly and easy to navigate.

The navigation bar is located at the top of the site and is on every page and the menu options can be found in the left hand corner. The menu is clear and concise in order to aid users to circumnavigate the website with ease.
Under the navigation bar is the company name and logo wih featured items underneath.
These items will be updated periodically with new product. All social media platforms have been linked to the site through the icons in the footer.
All items for sale have been linked to the company's etsy shop to enable customers to purchase desired items. All links open up in a new tab when seperated.



3. Reviews and ratings from other customers to be easy to locate.

A link to the company's Etsy reviews is included in the about page. A separate Customer Review page will be added in the future.

All new items will be placed on the Home page. In future a date of the site's last update will appear in the footer.

All promotional offers will be placed on the Home page, and that will include sales. A visitor counter will be added as the site development progresses.
